    <p>Park Shops is a building on North Campus that houses lecture halls and classrooms, the University Tutorial Center, and a Port City Java. It’s one of the more popular places on campus to study because of its casual ambiance and proximity to caffeine, but it isn’t without flaw. The majority of the issues with Park Shops come from its crowdedness and confusing layout—the lack of a clear <b>spacial navigation.</b><br><br> 
   <b>WHAT IS SPACIAL NAVIGATION?</b><br>
        The organization of a space in which one chooses to eat, work, or meet with others can have a great impact on how one might approach each activity. The shift from coffee shops traditionally being a community gathering place towards being more grab and go has changed the way that designers set up coffee shops. As far as traditional coffee shops go, the ability to define personal space and feel comfortable are primary concerns for patrons that spend lots of time in coffee shops. Each of these studies looks into how different aspects of dining room space and spatial organization of coffee shops can impact their roles in their communities.
