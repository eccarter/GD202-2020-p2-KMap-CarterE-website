        Qian (2014) focused on the meaning of coffee shop spaces within the context of modern American society. He refers to the definition of a coffee shop as being a “third place,” a place that people can go to enjoy each other’s company beyond the workplace and home. Qian emphasizes the importance of coffee shops to be accessible, neutral, and community-based. One of the important roles coffee shops hold in their communities is perhaps their ability to equalize—no matter what economic status, mood, or interests patrons may have, coffee shops serve as a place where (generally) everyone is welcome. The ability to have social interaction with all kinds of different strangers leads patrons to cultivate even more community. However, modern coffee shops in the United States are trending away from this mentality. More and more often it is likely to find a coffee shop focused on fast service more than the cultivation of social interaction—walk up and drive through coffee shops are becoming more common and with the growing popularity of such a format, there is some loss of community within coffee shops. Qian’s research involved traveling to different coffee shops to examine whether or not the “third place” still exists. His observations seemed to point to chain coffee shops being to blame for the loss of community space within coffee shops, as local coffee shops retained the typical spacious seating area for patrons aimed towards conversation and prolonged working. Many of the local coffee shops also had significantly more in-house seating for patrons to be able to stay. Qian found that both styles of coffee shop were frequented by members of their surrounding communities, but that only the more traditional layout still functioned as the “third space.”
