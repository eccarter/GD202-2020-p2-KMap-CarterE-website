    <b>WHAT CREATES COMFORT?</b><br>
        There are multiple aspects even beyond the dining room layout that impact a patron’s willingness and desire to stay at a coffee shop. Robson (1999) explores the psychology behind fast-food franchises’ restaurant layouts—is there more of a focus on turning tables over or is it more about ensuring that a patron has the ability to stay in the restaurant comfortably for the duration of their meal? Robson’s research points to the human preference for environments where individuals are allowed to have some control—environments that are not too stimulating or cramped. Within a public space, the need for individuals to be able to define and defend their personal space is one of the most important contributors to their ability to feel comfortable. Other environmental factors that impact how long individuals tend to stay in restaurant spaces include color, sound, lighting, and scent. In fast-food environments, brighter colors tend to make people feel as though time goes by faster. Loud, fast music also tends to push individuals out of public spaces as it increases anxiety. Light and smell are generally used to increase sales—bright lights attract attention, and baking scents tend to lead individuals to purchase goods. Coffee shops are no different, and often use each of these elements to control patron behavior to an extent. Coffee shops that tend to have a greater cultural impact generally have sections with varying intensity of light, different options for seating and soft ambient music playing—with these elements, patrons are significantly more likely to stay and linger for a while as opposed to getting their drink and then leaving.
